    <p>This year’s 2022 International Women’s Day theme is “Break the Bias,” a fitting call to action as the world emerges from a pandemic and considers the kind of future it wishes to build, the kind of values it holds important.  Companies, governments, communities now have the choice to rebuild deliberately, differently, and more inclusively so that women and marginalized groups have access to resources, support and opportunity. The tourism sector is certainly no exception.</p>
